<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

HedFund is a platform for funding projects on Hedera. It is a decentralized application that allows users to create projects and raise funds for them while allowing funders to fund some great projects of hedera ecosystem.
Hedera is quite efficient blockchain along with an interesting consensus mechanism yet we were not able to see much projects built on it, this led us to our idea to make a dapp where all these project could showcase their talent and get financial help as well which would help them grow at faster scale.

Our Dapp HedFund enables people to fund projects through interesting voting mechanisms like normal, quadratic, cubic or any type of custom voting. People who want to fund projects have to start a funding proposal, then projects would come to enlist themselves in voting. After that people would be able to vote for the projects based on their quality and finally money would be distributed as per voting mechanism defined by the funder. Funds would be recieved by the person who enlisted these projects helping them grow.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## How we built it?

We built it using hedera sdks and smart contracts. We deployed smart contracts on Hedera and then interacted with them from the front end using Hedera SDKs. We made interactive UI for users to interact easily with the dapp. we have integrated wallets like metamask, hashpack, and blade so that more and more users are able to use our dapp.
